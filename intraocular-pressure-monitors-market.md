<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intraocular Pressure Monitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Monitors</li><li>Non-Contact Monitors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intraocular pressure monitors are classified into two main types: contact and non-contact monitors. Contact monitors, such as applanation tonometers, require direct contact with the eye surface to measure pressure, providing precise and reliable readings. Non-contact monitors, often referred to as air puff tonometers, measure intraocular pressure without touching the eye, using a rapid puff of air. This method is more comfortable for patients and reduces the risk of infection, making both types essential in glaucoma management and eye care.</p></p>
