<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intrathecal Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Opioids</li><li>Baclofen</li><li>Ziconotide</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The intrathecal pump market is divided into several types based on the medication used. Opioids, including morphine and hydromorphone, are commonly utilized for pain management in chronic conditions. Baclofen is used primarily for spasticity management, particularly in neurological disorders. Ziconotide, a non-opioid analgesic, is effective for severe chronic pain and operates by blocking calcium channels. Each type addresses specific medical needs, providing targeted therapy and enhancing patient quality of life through controlled drug delivery directly into the spinal fluid. </p></p>
