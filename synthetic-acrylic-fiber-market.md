<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Synthetic Acrylic Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Spinning</li><li>Dry Spinning</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The synthetic acrylic fiber market primarily utilizes two production methods: wet spinning and dry spinning. In wet spinning, acrylic polymer is dissolved in a solvent, extruded through spinnerets into a coagulation bath, leading to fiber formation. This method typically results in finer and more uniform fibers. In contrast, dry spinning involves dissolving the polymer in a volatile solvent, which evaporates upon extrusion, forming fibers. Each method offers distinct advantages regarding fiber properties, production efficiency, and end-use applications.</p></p>
